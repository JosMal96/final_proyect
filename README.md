# Laptop Price Prediction using specifications ðŸ’»
## Overview
This project is part of the final assignment of IronHack Data Analytics bootcamp, for the Data Science track. The objective is to predict the 
Laptop Price Prediction using specifications using various machine learning regression and to evaluate their performance. Given the trend of new technologies
the focus on the models would be identifying the prices by their specs.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project they were titled laptops_test.csv and laptops_train.csv and it is sourced from Kaggle. It contains various features related to computer hardware and sodftware.
